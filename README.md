### Gaussian Process Regression

The main focus of this project was analyzing and understanding deeply the main
concept behind the algorithm building it from scratch.
A self made model of the algorithm was built on python to test the correctness of the
algorithm. Also, different experiments were done to see the robustness of the model in
different situations.
Finally this model of the algorithm was run on a standard dataset named Diesel Data
by Eigenvector Research Incorporated. The results came out to be better than some
of the previous papers without any special type of pre-processing.
